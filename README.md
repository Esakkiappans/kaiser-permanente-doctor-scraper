# Web Scraping Doctors Information from Kaiser Permanente

This Python script utilizes Selenium to scrape information about doctors from the Kaiser Permanente website.

## Description

This script navigates through the Kaiser Permanente website and extracts details such as doctor name, specialty, center, address, phone number, acceptance status, and accepted insurance plans.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- Chrome Web Browser
- Chrome WebDriver

## Usage

1. Install Python if you haven't already.
2. Install Selenium using `pip install selenium`.
3. Download the Chrome WebDriver compatible with your Chrome browser version.
4. Update the `webdriver.Chrome()` line in the script to point to the location of the Chrome WebDriver on your system.
5. Run the script (`python kaiser_scrape.py`).
6. Wait for the script to finish scraping. The results will be saved in a file named `all_data.txt`.
